Pass the computer to the first player, then click on the button which says "Pass to (name)" to play the first turn. Each turn entails placing some tiles from your hand with matching shape or color in a row, then clicking the "Place Tiles" button in the top right corner. Then, pass the computer to the next player. As the game continues, the board will grow like a crossword puzzle.

Each move is scored based on the length of the vertical and horziontal lines that are connected by the newly placed tiles. The score of any potential move is shown at the top of the screen, which is the sum of all the lines. If you complete a line of six tiles in a row of the same color or shape, you get 12 points for it instead of 6.
